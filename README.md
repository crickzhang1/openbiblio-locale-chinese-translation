openbiblio-locale-chinese-translation
=====================================

(author: crickzhang1)

Chinese translation for OpenBiblio i18n. For now the work is for
the latest release (0.7.1) of OpenBiblio.

## Status

* Currently only translation for simplified Chinese is ongoing.

### Progress of translation

The following list shows the progress for translations of each file under locale `zh_CN`:

* `zh_CN/admin.php`: __DONE__
* `zh_CN/cataloging.php`: __DONE__
* `zh_CN/circulation.php`: __DONE__
* `zh_CN/classes.php`: __DONE__
* `zh_CN/home.php`: __DONE__
* `zh_CN/metadata.php`: __DONE__
* `zh_CN/navbars.php`: __DONE__
* `zh_CN/opac.php`: __DONE__
* `zh_CN/reports.php`: __DONE__,
  except a few sorting criteria logical operators not translated.
* `zh_CN/shared.php`: __DONE__
* `zh_CN/template.php`: __DONE__
* `zh_CN/help`: Because the help files contain hard-coded html, which display
   unwanted spaces at linebreaks in a paragraph in Chinese that are not
   neccessary, content of each translated paragrah is all in one line, making
   sometimes very long lines. I don't find the souce of the improper, but
   if it is found, the long lines are better splited into short ones.   
* `zh_CN/help/barcodes.php`: __DONE__
* `zh_CN/help/biblioCopyEdit.php``: __DONE__
* `zh_CN/help/biblioEdit.php`: __DONE__
* `zh_CN/help/biblioSearch.php`: __DONE__
* `zh_CN/help/checkin.php`: __DONE__
